Latinoware is one of the largest free software events in the world and will celebrate its 21st edition in 2024. Since 2019, the event has had the Latin.Science academic track, which has been a great success. In 2020 and 2021, the editions were entirely online due to the pandemic, but the event maintained its high level of quality, with approximately 50 submissions in both years. In 2022, the event returned to the in-person and hybrid format, repeating the success with high-level papers. The 2023 edition, held at the Foz do Iguaçu Convention Center (CECONFI), continued this successful trajectory, with 41 papers published in SOL/SBC and an acceptance rate of 67%.

The success of Latin.Science is the result of the dedicated work and enthusiasm of the academic and professional community involved. We are immensely grateful to all who contributed with their work, reviews and participation in previous editions. It is this collaboration that strengthens our commitment to the dissemination of knowledge and the development of open technologies.

In 2024, we hope to once again count on the active participation of all of you. Latin.Science is a space to present and discuss innovative research, strengthen collaboration networks, and promote open science. We invite all researchers, students, and professionals to submit their work and join us in making this edition an even greater milestone in the history of the event.
